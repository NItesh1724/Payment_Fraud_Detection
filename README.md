# Payment_Fraud_Detection
I've created a draft project description for your GitHub repository. This description provides an overview of your payment fraud detection project, highlighting its key features and technologies used. It also mentions the project's potential applications and value.


**Payment Fraud Detection**
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in payment systems. Using a combination of historical transaction data and advanced algorithms, it aims to identify and flag potentially fraudulent activities in real-time.

**Key Features:**
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
Model evaluation and comparison
Real-time prediction capabilities
Visualization of fraud patterns and model performance

**Technologies Used:**

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib/Seaborn

This project demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning techniques to solve a critical problem in the financial sector. It can serve as a starting point for more advanced fraud detection systems or as an educational resource for those interested in financial data analysis and security.
